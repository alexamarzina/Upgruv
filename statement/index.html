		<p>Essentially, there are a whole bunch of things that get Gen Z's attention, 
		but you have to catch them before they fade. Fads are only cool for so long until 
		the next big thing comes around (like how 13 Reasons Why is overlooking Shameless 
		on Netflix for the time being.</p>

		part of the reason why teens/twenty-somethings find it all entertaining; their interest 
		doesn't have to be maintained for long. Gone are the days of everyone liking the same 
		thing at once for a long time. Now, everyone wants to be unique, so trends are quite 
		fleeting in today's world.</p>
